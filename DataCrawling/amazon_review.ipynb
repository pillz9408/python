May have to add serum and other products for it not to feel dry on my face after a few minutes. No strong scent, the scent goes away quickly too. I prefer to use this as a facial on the rest of my face while I’m doing a nose peel then afterwards either rinse it off or layer something more moisturizing on top.', 'I used this product with hopes to clear and smooth my skin. I woke up with itchy patches all over where I applied the product. Definitely had a bad reaction.', 'works fine for me', 'It should not include scent', 'Use this in the morning on top of my moisturizer and it is not sticky nor shiny. It hydrates my skin for the rest of the day. I also use before putting foundation on and it is awesome!', 'Simply aloe. No funky odor. I apply it to my face daily. I live in Colorado so the air is very dry. My skin was so dry and flakey. This definitely helps moisturize without clogging pores', 'works good for a small amount', 'Only received 1 not 3 as it should be', 'When it comes to moisturizing the skin on my face, very few items have worked for me, and almost everything clogs my pores and causes breakouts, no matter the brand or how clean the ingredients are. This aloe is one the few things that doesn’t cause those problems!It’s cooling, it’s lightweight, and it works great under makeup. Literally so affordable and will forever be a staple in my skincare routine.Can’t get enough of this stuff!!', 'I used one tub of this and I liked it but once I ran out, I decided to try a different brand and absolutely fell In love with it. This one is only 92% aloe Vera where the Aloderma brand is 96% and I noticed a tremendous difference. Yes, the Aloderma is slightly more $ than this one but it IS WORTH IT! This one made my face feel moisturized for a hot few minutes where the Aloderma brand feels like it moisturizes a lot better! Also, this one feels more watered down than the Aloderma brand. Like I said, it is ok, but the Aloderma brand is MUCH better!', \"Don't bother. Get yourself some pure 100% aloe. This stuff smells awful and is full of random crap.\", 'This is the real deal. Most aloe products don’t contain 100% aloe. I watched a video about this one and was impressed in the way it was harvested and packaged. It didn’t disappoint.', \"Ok, I have had red spots on my forearms for years.  Not sure whether it was eczema or posarius.  As I am not into chemicals I always research for natural products to handle any issues.  I started using Cortizone-10.  It helped some but the spots were still there, on my forearms.  Then I started using Cerave moisturizing cream.  It took awhile but the spots had reduced some but were still there.  I used this twice a day for several months.Another issue I had was easy bruising on my forearms and the back of my hands.  The slightest bump would give me a bruise.  When that happened I started using DerMend bruise formula.  It worked but it would take about a week, to get rid of the bruise.One day I was doing research on Amazon to see if there was anything else that was better for my issues.  I ran across Nature Republic Aloe Vera 92% Soothing Gel.  I read several of the reviews and decided I would give it a try.I started using the product on July 3rd.  Twice a day for two weeks.  In the morning when I first got up and at night before I went to bed.After the first week my spots started reducing and the redness was disappearing.  I was really surprised that it started happening so quickly.  It is so easy to apply and dries quickly. I dab one finger in the Gel and start to rub it on my arm with my hand.  A small amount goes a long way.  You don't need a lot.  After 3 weeks all the redness was gone and so were the spots.  I was amazed.  I now use it once a day, first thing in the morning, when I get up.  I also apply it to my face, like I said a little goes a long way.Something I was not expecting.  I'm 85 and as I said I bruise very easily on my forearms.  Slightest brush on a arm and I had a bruise.  No more, I have not had a bruise since I started using this product.  I was not expecting that at all.  I got out of my truck this morning and I banged my left forearm pretty hard on the door jam.  I thought ok, that is going to bruise.  Now we'll see.  Two hours later and nothing.  In the past it would appear in minutes after the contact.My wife is totally amazed at how young my skin is looking.  She just ordered some for herself.This is the first time I have used Aloe Vera and I am totally convinced that I will continue using this product for the rest of my life.For your info nobody has paid me for this review.  I typically don't write that many reviews but I had to do this one.  This product is amazing.\", 'Pure aloe Vera at a great price, nice packaging.

Alcohol shouldn’t be anywhere near sensitive skin. I was initially going to use it in my face but I definitely DO NOT RECOMMEND THAT.

It helped make the healing process quicker and also helped so the itchiness and burning I was feeling. Granted I used this with another the other product I use to mix it with and it did wonders.

Considering this is aloe gel, itll great to cool down my face after a waxing session.As for the size, its quiet large and at a very affordable price in comparison to most serums. Honestly, I wish I found out that my skin loves aloe vera sooner. Ive spent too much money on serums that has charged way too much for one little bottle. Also doesnt work as good in comparison to aloe gel.  This product has definetly reduced the cost of my skincare stash, and replaced two products which was previously my previous serum and my post waxing calming cream.The only problem I have with this product is the ingredient \"parfum\".

I will definitely recommend this!', 'Great!', 'NICE PRODUCT', 'Quality Was really very great and effective', \"Cooling gel, the scent i believe is too strong.  You get a great amount.  I have super dry skin so mu face wasn't moisturized enough from it and my skin broke out everytime I used it. My 11 year old daughter loves it and it works fine for her. She gets acne but her skin doesn't break out from it.\", 'Use it as facial mask with V-E and cream together. It’s thick and No odd smell. Good to have it!', \"I always have to have this on hand. I've been using it for the past year and my skin is significantly healthier, prettier, softer, and has a glow. It moisturizes without making your face oily, doesn't break you out, and I swear since using this and drinking more water, I get compliments on my skin constantly. I was mistaken for a teenager when I went to open a bank account and I'm pushing 30 so that was quite the compliment. I know it was because of my skin.\"]\n"
