You could basically take the lid off and the seal would still be intact. the little jar was wet from the gel. there was no actual paper seal inside the jar. I feel uncomfortable using it, but im also wondering if that's how they usually come, even when you go buy the ones at the store. Would be nice to get one with a proper seal.\", 'I opened one and it’s exactly same consistency with the one I am currently using. Tried it and sure is the same scent also. Very happy with this product.', 'Shop at your local store or another online store because this was extremely over priced. After buying it here, I found 5 other places selling this for around $4-$5. The product is still the same and great for my skin. Healed my scars fast.', 'Received as advertised.  Good product.', 'This soothing gel has a very light pleasing scent....goes on smooth, not sticky at all.  Comes in an attractive jar too.  Doctor recommended to try use of aloe vera for psoriasis condition so will continue with this brand.', \"There's so many companies that try to monopolize products for cancer patients but this isn't one of them.

Perfect for people like me with severe skin allergy', \"I've been using this aloe vera gel for 2 years and can't go without it. I use it right after cleansing, which is so moisturizing for my dry skin. It acts like a skincare primer -- I let it almost dry out before going in with my cream-based moisturizer, sunscreen (in the AM), and serums (in the PM) It also really helps with irritation, sunburn, and itching. And it just feels so cold and calming on your face after a busy day... just my ride or die product.\", 'Straight aloe, cool feeling after a hard day of being outside! Not the alcohol scent the others have.', 'It very light weighted, it alone isn’t enough to moisturize my face. May have to add serum and other products for it not to feel dry on my face after a few minutes. No strong scent, the scent goes away quickly too. I prefer to use this as a facial on the rest of my face while I’m doing a nose peel then afterwards either rinse it off or layer something more moisturizing on top.', 'I used this product with hopes to clear and smooth my skin. I woke up with itchy patches all over where I applied the product. Definitely had a bad reaction.', 'works fine for me', 'It should not include scent', 'Use this in the morning on top of my moisturizer and it is not sticky nor shiny. It hydrates my skin for the rest of the day. I also use before putting foundation on and it is awesome!', 'Simply aloe. No funky odor. I apply it to my face daily. I live in Colorado so the air is very dry. My skin was so dry and flakey.

This aloe is one the few things that doesn’t cause those problems!It’s cooling, it’s lightweight, and it works great under makeup. Literally so affordable and will forever be a staple in my skincare routine.Can’t get enough of this stuff!!', 'I used one tub of this and I liked it but once I ran out, I decided to try a different brand and absolutely fell In love with it. This one is only 92% aloe Vera where the Aloderma brand is 96% and I noticed a tremendous difference. Yes, the Aloderma is slightly more $ than this one but it IS WORTH IT! This one made my face feel moisturized for a hot few minutes where the Aloderma brand feels like it moisturizes a lot better! Also, this one feels more watered down than the Aloderma brand. Like I said, it is ok, but the Aloderma brand is MUCH better!', \"Don't bother. Get yourself some pure 100% aloe. This stuff smells awful and is full of random crap.\", 'This is the real deal. Most aloe products don’t contain 100% aloe. I watched a video about this one and was impressed in the way it was harvested and packaged. It didn’t disappoint.', \"Ok, I have had red spots on my forearms for years.  Not sure whether it was eczema or posarius.  As I am not into chemicals I always research for natural products to handle any issues.  I started using Cortizone-10.  It helped some but the spots were still there, on my forearms.  Then I started using Cerave moisturizing cream.  It took awhile but the spots had reduced some but were still there.  I used this twice a day for several months.Another issue I had was easy bruising on my forearms and the back of my hands.  The slightest bump would give me a bruise.  When that happened I started using DerMend bruise formula.  It worked but it would take about a week, to get rid of the bruise.One day I was doing research on Amazon to see if there was anything else that was better for my issues.  I ran across Nature Republic Aloe Vera 92% Soothing Gel.  I read several of the reviews and decided I would give it a try.I started using the product on July 3rd.  Twice a day for two weeks.  In the morning when I first got up and at night before I went to bed.After the first week my spots started reducing and the redness was disappearing.  I was really surprised that it started happening so quickly.  It is so easy to apply and dries quickly. I dab one finger in the Gel and start to rub it on my arm with my hand.  A small amount goes a long way.  You don't need a lot.  After 3 weeks all the redness was gone and so were the spots.  I was amazed.  I now use it once a day, first thing in the morning, when I get up.  I also apply it to my face, like I said a little goes a long way.Something I was not expecting.  I'm 85 and as I said I bruise very easily on my forearms.  Slightest brush on a arm and I had a bruise.  No more, I have not had a bruise since I started using this product.  I was not expecting that at all.  I got out of my truck this morning and I banged my left forearm pretty hard on the door jam.  I thought ok, that is going to bruise.  Now we'll see.  Two hours later and nothing.  In the past it would appear in minutes after the contact.My wife is totally amazed at how young my skin is looking.  She just ordered some for herself.This is the first time I have used Aloe Vera and I am totally convinced that I will continue using this product for the rest of my life.For your info nobody has paid me for this review.  I typically don't write that many reviews but I had to do this one.  This product is amazing.\", 'Pure aloe Vera at a great price, nice packaging. Soothes and hydrates', 'This is absolutely one of the best moisturizers for oily skin. It’s very light weight and you don’t need much to put on. I use it in the morning and at night.

I mix this up with another product after I’ve finished the rest of my skin care and I use it as my night mask. It has done wonders to my face. I recently went through my first and worst allergic reaction on my face due to a cream I had bought and it had completely burned the lower half of my face which caused itchiness, inflammation, horrible redness, ofc burning sensation 24/7, little bumps on the affected area and this helped me so, so much.

Because of its watery viscosity, it also absorbs into my skin in a way that leaves me feeling smooth and clean without that \"caked on\" feeling that other moisturizers give me. There\\'s also no strong perfume-y smell to it, which I count as a bonus, personally.Face-wise, I have combination skin, so finding a moisturizer that works has been a nightmare my whole life. For years I settled for a lotion that at least had an SPF in it and gave up at that. I have terrible (sometimes painful) dry patches mixed with an oily T-zone, and all I could do was slap on a lotion that just made my skin feel pasty and didn\\'t actually fix either problem... (And heavier duty moisturizers either made my oil product WORSE, or made me break out with a rash.)Not anymore! This is going to be my go-to from now on. The awful dry patches I get on my cheeks are gone with just a dab each. I use even less on my forehead to keep it clean and prevent over-production of oil and that\\'s worked too.

At first I thought it was very lightweight and moisturizing, and put it on my hands and face right before bed as they tend to experience the worst dryness.When I woke up the next morning, my face was red with a rash, my clear skin which had no acne suddenly had a massive breakout over my whole face of about 20 or so itchy zits and I had bumps/ hives on the backs of my hands. I rarely have ever had this severe of an allergic reaction to skin products before and I have used aloe many times in the past so I know it’s not a reaction to the plant itself.I suspect it might be the chemical fragrance added to the aloe Vera gel as I have experienced similar reactions to perfumes before, although definitely not to this degree.If it hadn’t been for my reaction, I would have given this product a good rating as it did seem to temporarily help sooth my skin...however that appeared to just be the calm before the storm. :(', 'Before I even get to write the review I tapped on what I ordered and it says it’s not available(??), I had to search up this product again to review for it.Stuff I don’t like: it has fragrance, you can literally smell it.

And I’ve use it as a face mask, to control itchiness from a mosquito bite, under eye, after shave, shaving gel, hair mask, hair gel... instead alternating between face serum - it’s amazing!', 'Great product! Love it!', 'The smell is meh but overall 10/10', 'This is loaded with rubbing alcohol. You can smell it the second you open the jar. You can also smell the aloe, and the jar is full of an otherwise pleasant product with a pleasant gel texture. It looks green in the package, but it\\'s clear.Those with sensitive skin might notice this burns your face. Those without might not notice anything; the moisturizing quality of the aloe cancels the immediate drying effects. Unfortunately, those wear off, and long term, your skin is still dried out. For those of us with oily skin, this might cause more sebum production. Others may just notice tightness. If you don\\'t realize it\\'s this product causing it, you might just use more. Again, the aloe provides a temporary soothing sensation and you\\'re left thinking it\\'s a good product.This is why it\\'s important to learn about ingredients *and* reviews. Reviews alone can\\'t tell us the long term effects of a product because we\\'re not conducting an experiment. We\\'re making casual observation. People have \"observed\" that garlic treats HIV, that leeches cure a fever, and that childbirth is safest when the mother gets no fresh air for 9 months. And those were the observations of thousands of people, often over hundreds of years.Either read up on which ingredients are harmful to skin or ask your dermatologist.  No one deserves to have rubbing alcohol on their face. I hope no one has to suffer the burning, red face I did with this. Now it sits on my skin care shelf taunting me with my other regrets.', 'My skin looks so smooth and feels the same. Youthful and moisturized... Ive only been using it for 4 days and I love it. I hurried back to purchase 2 more. It gives me the same results as an actual aloe plant leaf....nice. I Love it already!!!', \"I'm just in love with this product.i love everything of this product- it's refreshing soothing scent, it's mositurizing quality,being non sticky,not heavy on ur skin and a quick absorbent. It has 92percent of aloe coz of which it can be put to multiple use like as eye pack, mositurizer, as conditioner for ur hair,as after shave. Overall a must buy.\", \"really fast shipping, great product.  I was amazed to see how large the amount was (10 oz not 2 oz as I assumed.)  This is really good, really pure aloe vera.  It absorbs instantly.  It doesn't feel sticky or greasy or tight.  It has a mild cucumber smell which is not at all unpleasant.  It is hard to find quality aloe vera that isn't mixed down with all sorts of other junk and over priced.  This is the real deal at a great price.\", \"It's pretty helpful especially for sensitive skin, id put it in the ice box for 15-20 mins to really get a cooling sensation\", 'Love this stuff! My skin has not felt this moisturized in a long time.', 'I hope this review would be helpful.I have been using it for two weeks then go back here to review honestly.I’m in love with it after the very first time use, and I have an extra sensitive skin. I believe it’s is an affordable and good investment for you.It has a good, natural, light herbal smell, and especially it’s so fresh. It’s quickly dry after 5-6 minutes. I highly recommend that you should keep it in the fridge, it will make you feel so good when you apply aloe gel on your skin.You can use it for your body as well.I went swimming with my friends couple days ago and my skin was burnt, then I applied it on my body after shower and it worked. My body skin did not feel hurt the day after.', 'I love wearing this under my makeup. Great scent. I love it!', 'Teen uses it on his face as moisturizer for oily, acne skin. He likes it, which is a compliment!', 'Not the most most cooling aloe I’ve ever used but works well for sunburn and good for price', 'A little def goes along way... it’s smell is very light and refreshing and the cooling gel feels great.  My skin feels moisturizer.  (I’ve started going biking daily and I use this after my workout-after I wash my face) to cool my skin down. I loved it so much I ordered another one and shipped it to my mom.', 'I love how refreshed and calm my face feels after applying a layer of this. I have noticed I break out way less frequently, my skin is softer, and my skin looks (and feels) fresh. Paired with Biotin, this is a skin saver!', 'A little goes along way. Not sticky or runny. Perfect texture', 'amazing. Works perfectly, helped us already with burnings, bruises, dry skin, even with stacked glass piece under the skin,', 'I have very sensitive skin and eczema. All skin care products i have used in the past have caused adverse reactions. But not this stuff. My skin feels moisturized without the greasy feeling, and I love the smoothness after it absorbs into my skin. Will buy again', 'This is the only aloe Vera soothing gel I use for my skin.  I purchased my first one in 2016, now 4 years later I still use it.You get a lot product for the price. For example I use it as a soothing cream, apply it all over my skin and leave it for 10min and then wash it off! Leaves your skin super hydrated!! I recommend this product for sensitive, dry skin.', 'Used this to make had sanitizer. Nice scent.', 'I am using it for a week now and I dont see any difference yet in my skin. Will wait and see for few more days', 'Makes skin very dry', \"I have been using this for over 5 years now! I always have a tub on standby in case I get a sunburn because it isn't sticky at all but is still very cooling. I also use it as a general body moisturizer in the spring and summer when I don't need a really heavy moisturizer, especially on my legs. I have even used this as a base to make my own hand sanitizer with isopropyl alcohol. It is definitely a jack of all trades product!\", \"When I started looking at this product I wasn't blown away at first, I was recommended to it by numerous youtube videos and many people who told me they have used it in the past so I had to see for myself. After using it each night before my skin started to smooth out, and it almost felt calming putting it on. When you put it on after washing your face it gives you a cool rush and refreshing feeling that will prime you for an amazing sleep the night after.\", \"I love this stuff. It does dry out my skin a little if I just use it alone but not using it for skin this time. The lid did come broken so there's a hole in the middle of it. Other than that just what I wanted.\", 'This product is amazing! It moisturized my super dry skin the first time I used it. With all the hand washing we’re doing these days, using this product will help with dry skin. Will order another tub for my oldest son.', 'The product is good but it absorb the moisture in the air. The gel will dilute a lot which is awful. But in the begining, it is pretty good.', 'I absolutely love this Aloe gel. I have extremely dry skin and this stuff works amazingly. Definitely would recommend this!', 'Disgusting that this was made in China! God knows what chemicals are in it. Sent it right back.', \"I LOVE this stuff. I can't do a lot of lotions because they make me break out, but this was perfectly moisturizing w/out breakouts. It has so many uses too: footmask, face mask, lip treatment, hairfly aways. For this price, I wasn't expecting such a fantastic product. I'll definitely buy more when mine runs out.\", \"Like others I couldn't find and hand sanitizer and decided to make my own. The aloe is not as thick and jelly like as I would of expected. It's more on the watery side. The smell is great. And so far my hands have been smelling good and moisturized. In case anyone wants to know I used 99% alcohol 2/3 cup and 1/3 cup aloe. Just those two and mixed and placed into a spray bottle.\", 'I don\\'t usually review a product until I have used it for awhile but I wanted to comment on this one.  I have used other Aloe products as facial moisturizers for several years and this product is wonderful.  I have what I would call normal skin although I cannot use oily products.  I am 79 years old and what I really like is the slight drawing effect as the product dries while still leaving my skin soft and smooth.  I was concerned with the negative reviews about alcohol so I checked them out.  The \"alcohol\" is propylene glycol which is a humectant (draws moisture from the air) and used very frequently in the cosmetic/food industry, not the type of alcohol one buys for first aid purposes.  I did not detect an odor of alcohol in this product and, in fact, found the scent to be a refreshing one.  So far I am very pleased with the product and the amount in the container.  It should last a long time.', \"I love this product can't wake up without using it. The best product ever helped reduce my Acne\", 'always good', 'Excelente!!!', 'I’ve always struggled with acne and dry, sensitive skin. I’ve tried countless moisturizers to help reduce my dryness and redness but none of them have really worked. This moisturizer works amazingly. After a few days, my skin adjusted to the formula and has felt amazing! It is very cooling and really soothes my red, dry skin! It dries down well and isn’t noticeable at all. I highly recommend this for anyone with dry, sensitive skin!', \"It's nice to put on a moisturizer and not have to worry about little break out a few hours later.\", 'I have combo skin ! This completely dried my skin out and caused more redness and dry than I already have .', 'The price is good for the quality it provides.', 'Works very for my face', 'I was skeptical that I’d by chance get a fake Nature Republic Aloe Vera Gel but when I received my order I made sure to check if it was the real deal. I’ll post photos to prove it’s real or fake', 'No scent! Very nice and lasts all day', 'Fastest deliver and good product.. I like the way they pack 🥰🥰 best product ever', 'Someone brought me some of this aloe from Korea and I am so happy to be able to find it to order in the states. It has a very light scent which does not bother my sensitive nose. I use it as a light moisturizer right after washing and toning my face and neck before bed and also in the morning before my makeup.', \"Absolutely favorite skin product. The value is incredible first of all. It comes in a LARGE container. I've been using it twice a day for about 2 months now. I find it so refreshing and moisturizing. In the morning I massage a small amount into my skin while my face is still wet immediately after washing with a rice based korean foam cleanser. At night I glob it on and it absorbs so nicely without any oily residue. My skin feels clean and soft after using this product. The smell is fresh and light. I use it so often and there's still much more left in the jar. I am now recommending this aloe gel to everyone I know. I'm super impressed by this product.\", '😍😍😍😍😍', 'My skin is dry and yet sensitive! Works so good and smells fantastic! My Grandkids use it as well!', 'Love this product! I use it every time after i wash my face.', 'I love this product. It works like a miracle.', '👍', 'Great product', \"I love how lightweight this product is. Doesn't feel harmful on my skin at all. I've used it for years and have nothing but good things to say about it\"]\n"
